# About Me
 
	## Interest: Gaming-I have always longed to get a PC to further expand the games in which are available to me and I have gotten one right before the start of the semester and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  
		     Rock/rare ore collecting-This is something which I have done since I was a kid and my world was opened to the various typed, colors and shapes of rocks and ores. 
		    Writing: I have always loved to write and have been completing several projects mainly fan fictions for my favorite shows/movies. I like to expand upon the already created world while trying to stay true to the author's vision. 

	## Websites I Recommend: https://mail.yahoo.com-This is my default mailbox that I have used since I was 18
